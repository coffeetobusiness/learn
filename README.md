# learn
A simple learning solution for everyone for free who want to learn technical or online skills.


## Why?
We have a great team of enthusiastic people who understand the technologies very well. We also have a good amount of experience in working with clients around the globe. 
We are thinking while working for the clients, we can also spend some time in upgrading, learning and most important training other people for free. 

## How?
We don't want to teach or train millions of people in one shot. Instead we want to teach people who can teach other for free. We believe that helping people for free can help more people to get employment, promotions, self fulfillment and satisfaction in life. There may be many dimensions to this one action, but we just want to do with what we have.
