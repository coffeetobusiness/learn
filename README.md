# learn
A simple learning solution for everyone for free who want to learn technical or online skills.


## Why?
We have a great team of enthusiastic people who understand the technologies very well. We also have a good amount of experience in working with clients around the globe. 
We are thinking while working for the clients, we can also spend some time in upgrading, learning and most important training other people for free.
